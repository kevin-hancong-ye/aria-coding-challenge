## Project Description

This web application is a page that consist of some html components with aria techniques being applied
to them according to https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA to be disability friendly.
I've structured and built the page layout to enforce landmark region structure.

The components in the main section are just some basic every day seen components. e.g table, article, alert messages, tables, accodians.

Note: the design is very simple as I did not put much emphasis on the overall look of the application
and focuses were put in techniques over look.
Also I used create-react-app and sass so it made it easier to write javascript and apply styling to the components.
